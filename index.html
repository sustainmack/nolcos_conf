								<strong>Title:</strong> Networks of Dissipative Systems: Compositional Certification of Stability, Performance, and Safety</p>
								<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Existing computational tools for control synthesis and verification do not scale well to today's large scale, networked systems.  Recent advances, such as sum of squares relaxations for polynomial nonnegativity, have made it possible to numerically search for Lyapunov functions, to estimate regions of attraction, and to certify measures of performance; however, these procedures are applicable only to problems of modest size.</p>
								<p>In this talk we address networks where the subsystems are amenable to standard analytical and computational methods but the interconnection, taken as a whole, is beyond the reach of these methods. To break up the task of certifying network properties into subproblems of manageable size, we make use of dissipativity properties that serve as abstractions of the detailed dynamical models of the subsystems. We combine these abstractions to derive network level stability, performance, and safety guarantees in a compositional fashion. This approach is particularly powerful when one exploits the structure of the interconnection and identifies subsystem dissipativity properties favored by the type of interconnection.  We exhibit several such interconnections that are of practical importance. The talk also emphasizes computational tools, such as semidefinite programming and distributed optimization, that assist us in applications of this compositional approach. Finally, we demonstrate how exploiting symmetries in the interconnection structure enables significant computational savings.</p>
								<p><strong>Biography:</strong> Murat Arcak is a professor at U.C. Berkeley in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department.He received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey (1996) and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California, Santa Barbara (1997 and 2000). His research is in dynamical systems and control theory with applications to synthetic biology, multi-agent systems, and transportation. He received a CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation in 2003, the Donald P.

						<strong>Title:</strong> Moments of Nonlinear Systems: From Model Reduction to Identification and Circuits Theory</p>
						<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The notion of moment for linear systems is generalized to nonlinear, possibly time-delay, systems and to general classes of signal generators (i.e. interpolation points). It is shown that this notion provides a powerful tool for the solution of model reduction problems, for the identification of reduced order model from input-output data and for the analysis of power electronic circuits. In particular, it is shown that moments yield a generalization of the so-called phasor transform to circuits with power electronics components.</p>

						<strong>Title:</strong> Physics Based Modeling for Design and Control of Thermal-Fluid Systems</p>
						<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this presentation we discuss several modeling and computational issues involved with control of thermal-fluid systems. The problems are motivated by applications to the design and operation of aircraft environmental control systems (ECS) and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems for buildings. These systems are typical of many of todays complex multi-physics, data-driven, uncertain physical systems arise in a wide variety of modern engineered systems. Physics based modeling produces mathematical models that are interconnected systems of ordinary and partial differential equations, empirical maps and table look-ups. It is important to keep in mind that if any one of the system’s components is infinite dimensional, then the composite system is infinite dimensional and should be treated as a distributed parameter control system.</p> 
						<p>Although such systems arise naturally when the problem is multidisciplinary (e.g., aeroelasticity, thermal-fluids) and often requires connecting different types of mathematical equations through boundary conditions, similar issues arise when actuator dynamics are included in the control model. We present examples to highlight some technical issues that occur when dealing with interconnected systems and then focus on a special class of composite systems that occur when actuator dynamics are included as part of the model. Finally, we suggest some new application areas that offer enormous opportunities for researchers interested in distributed parameter control.</p>

						<strong>Title:</strong> Computational Nonlinear Control Theory: A Path Forward for Meeting the Real World Challenges</p>
						<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> High performance complex systems prevalent in real world applications demand more powerful computational tools and new rigorous methodologies that could deal with the underlying high-dimensional, nonlinear, multi-layered nature of these systems. For control and design of these systems, existing methodologies fail to accomplish the dual tasks of providing rigor within a computational-based approach.  These frameworks are either focused on large-scale simulations without foundations on establishing errors and performance bounds or they are focused on rigorous analysis of much simplified systems that are not representative of the complex systems of interest. To overcome these deficiencies, the new trends in computational control theory based on development of scalable, accurate algorithms for the controlled systems could take the lead in solving some of our outstanding problems such as flow control, control of large networks, design and control of electric power grids and control of swarms among others.   In this talk, some of the challenges and approaches will be addressed.</p>

						<strong>Title:</strong> Asymptotic Stability of Saddle-point Dynamics and Its Role in Network Coordination</p>
						<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Primal-dual algorithms are saddle-point dynamics for determining the primal and dual solutions of (in)equality constrained convex optimization problems. These dynamics are used to solve problems in multiple scenarios, including network resource allocation in wireless systems, stabilization and optimization in power networks, and distributed learning in games.  The specific structure of saddle-point dynamics make them particularly well-suited for solving in a distributed way networked optimization problems that involve aggregate objective functions with constraints that can be expressed locally.  In this talk, we examine various conditions under which the set of saddle points is asymptotically stable under the saddle-point dynamics of a continuously differentiable function.  Our convergence results are based on different properties of the function such as convexity-concavity, its behavior along the proximal normals to the set of saddle points, and its linearity in one argument. We illustrate our discussion with examples from distributed optimization, network bargaining, and zero-sum games.</p>

						<strong>Title:</strong> Cybernetic Cycling: A Nonlinear Switched Systems Approach to Facilitate Neurological Rehabilitation</p>
						<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Application of an electric field across skeletal muscle causes muscle contractions that produce limb movement. Closed-loop computer controlled stimulation of the muscles yields a cybernetic system where a person’s limbs can be tasked to follow a desired trajectory or force profile. Motivation for such a cybernetic system includes advanced rehabilitative outcomes (i.e., neuroplasticity and restoration of function) for individuals with neurological disorders. A challenge to developing these outcomes is that muscle activation dynamics are uncertain and nonlinear, and the dynamics of limb motion also require the coordinated switching among multiple muscle groups. Moreover, artificial stimulation of the muscle is highly inefficient, leading to rapid muscle fatigue, which can limit the therapeutic outcomes. This talk focuses on how perspectives from and advances in robotics / automation / control systems can be used to overcome these challenges. Underlying theories and experimental results for various closed-loop electrical stimulation methods will be described including recent advances in cybernetic cycling where a robotic bicycle is combined with an electrically stimulated person to facilitate various rehabilitative objectives.</p>

						<strong>Title:</strong> Nonlinear Observer Design for GNSS- and Camera-Aided Strapdown Inertial Navigation Systems</p>

						<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The navigation system is one of the key components when designing modern guidance, navigation and control (GNC) systems. Navigation is usually defined as the task of determining an object’s position, velocity and attitude (PVA) based on various types of information. For decades the Kalman filter (KF), and nonlinear extensions thereof, has been used to provide integrated navigation solutions based on different types of measurements. One disadvantage of the KF is its relatively high computational complexity, with the number of internal states growing quadratically with the number of actual estimates. Another disadvantage is that the KF is developed for linear systems and stability can be difficult or impossible to prove for nonlinear extensions such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Consequently, there is a growing interest in the design of nonlinear observers for strapdown inertial navigation systems (INS), which can provide explicit stability guarantees and reduced computational complexity. In recent years there has been a breakthrough in the development of low-cost inertial measurement units (IMUs) based on micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) technology. The IMU is the key component of a strapdown INS and nonlinear observer theory makes it possible to develop highly effective navigation.  Applications are low-cost consumer electronics, cars, navigation systems for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), ships, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) etc.</p>

						<p>In this talk, a globally exponentially stable (GES) observer for attitude and gyro bias estimation is presented. The attitude observer uses gyro measurements and two or more pairs of vector measurements, typically body-fixed acceleration and magnetic field measurements. Velocity estimates from optical flow camera measurements can also be used. The attitude observer avoids the well-known topological obstructions to global stability by not confining the attitude estimate to SO(3), but rather estimating a full rotation matrix with nine degrees of freedom. A quaternion-based representation for effective implementation, which guarantees semiglobal exponential stability, is also presented. Next, a translational motion observer (TMO) for estimation of position and linear velocity is presented. The attitude and TMO observers form a feedback interconnection, which is analyzed using Lyapunov theory. Explicit stability requirements for GES are given. The nonlinear observer can be implemented using IMU, magnetometer and GNSS measurements. Extensions to camera-based navigation are also discussed. Low-cost integrated navigation systems using nonlinear observer theory is an emerging technology for autonomous vehicles operating in uncertain and harsh environments. The presentation focuses on the theory of nonlinear observers, stability properties and experimental validation of the methods using experimental data obtained from fixed-wing UAV experiments.</p>

						<strong>Title:</strong> Control Problems in Building Energy Retrofit and Maintenance Planning</p>
						<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents a series of control problems in prioritizing building energy retrofit and maintenance plans through a review of our studies. The building energy retrofits can be strategically performed on policy level, building energy management level, building energy system level and unit level. Based on existing research efforts, this study casts the optimal building maintenance planing problem into a general control system framework. Unlike traditional control applications, this study argues that the control system framework is also applicable to the building energy management level, which will significantly improve the sustainability of realized energy savings and cost-effectiveness of building energy retrofits. In a general control framework, a number of research problems in the control systems are systematically formulated, namely 1) control system decay dynamics modeling; 2) control system inputs and model uncertainties; 3) control system outputs; 4) control system uncertainties and disturbances; 5) control system algorithm; and 6) grouping and modeling. The proposed control problems bring out the intrinsic relationship of reliability engineering, maintenance engineering and control engineering in the broad directions of energy efficiency and optimization. Investigations into the proposed control problems will contribute to further improvements in the building energy retrofit and maintenance plans than the currently prevailing engineering practice.</p>

Monterey was the original capital of Alta California in both the Mexican and American periods. There are numerous adobes from the Mexican era. The Marriott is one block from Monterey’s Fisherman’s Wharf and less than a mile from Steinbeck’s Cannery Row and the world famous Monterey Bay Aquarium.</p>

	                		<p>The conference will be held at the <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/mryca-monterey-marriott/" target="_blank" alt="Monterey Marriot">Marriott Hotel</a>, 350 Calle Principal, in the center of Monterey.

	                		<h4>Airports</h4>
	                		<p>The closest airport is Monterey (MRY) but there are only a few flights to/from this airport and they tend to be more expensive. San Jose Airport (SJC), 75 miles from Monterey, and San Francisco Airport (SFO), 115 miles from Monterey, are convenient alternatives. One can rent a car or take the <a href="http://www.montereyairbus.com/" target="_blank" alt="Monterey Airbus">Monterey Airbus</a>.</p>

	                		<h4>Directions</h4>
							<p>From Monterey Airport take a cab to the Monterey Marriott Hotel.</p>
